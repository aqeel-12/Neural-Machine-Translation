In the modern world, machine translation is a necessary piece of technology to break down communication boundaries. It has advanced significantly in recent years and is now widely used in both the commercial and nonprofit sectors. Due to a lack of resources, the technology for the English and Urdu language pair is still in its infancy. Neural networks are currently dominating the field of translation techniques given their ability to provide a single, large neural network with an attention mechanism, sequence-to-sequence translation, and long-short term model. This paper discusses two approaches of machine translation from source language to target language using neural networks. The techniques discussed in the paper include character level sequence to sequence modelling, and word level sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation with attention. BLEU score has been used as an evaluation criterion for both techniques. A BLEU score of 0.5 has been achieved on character-level seq2seq model and state of the art result of 0.69 has been achieved on NMT with attention model.
